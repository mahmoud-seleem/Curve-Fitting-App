## Description
A multi-threaded application for curve fitting and interpolation to demonstrate the best way of fitting data by using one or more chunks and a graphical map for the error.

## Features
- Fitting data with with one or mutiple chunks
- Options of polynomial degree from 0 to 100
- Fitted equation in latex format
- Extrapolation by choosing data percentage
- Error map with multiple color palates
- Error map control over axis (overlap between chunks, degree of polynomial, number of chunks)
